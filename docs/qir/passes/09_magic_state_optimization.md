# Magic State Optimization Pass

**Category**: Standard Pass  
**Status**: Production-ready

## Overview

**Purpose**: Optimize magic state usage for fault-tolerant circuits.

Magic states are resource states used to implement non-Clifford gates. Optimizing their usage reduces the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## Mini-Tutorial

### What are Magic States?

**Magic states** = Resource states for non-Clifford gates

**Key Facts**:
- Clifford gates: Transversal (cheap)
- Non-Clifford gates: Need magic states (expensive)
- T gate: Requires |T⟩ = (|0⟩ + e^(iπ/4)|1⟩)/√2

### Magic State Distillation

```
15 noisy |T⟩ states → 1 high-fidelity |T⟩ state

Cost: ~1000-10000 physical gates per logical T gate
```

### Optimization Goals

1. **Reduce magic state count**
2. **Reuse magic states when possible**
3. **Optimize distillation protocols**
4. **Schedule production efficiently**
