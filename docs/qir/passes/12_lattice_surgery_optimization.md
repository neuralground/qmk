## Mini-Tutorial

### What is Lattice Surgery?

**Lattice surgery** = Performing operations by merging/splitting surface code patches

**Operations**:
- **Merge**: Combine two patches
- **Split**: Separate patches
- **Measure**: Extract information

### Why Optimize?

- **Reduce space-time volume**: Fewer physical qubits Ã— time
- **Minimize merges/splits**: Expensive operations
- **Optimize routing**: Better patch placement

---

## Performance

- **Space-time volume reduction**: 20-40% typical
- **Critical for**: Surface code implementations
- **Best for**: Fault-tolerant quantum computers
