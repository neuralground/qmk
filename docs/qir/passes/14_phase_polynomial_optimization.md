# Phase Polynomial Optimization Pass (EXPERIMENTAL)

**Category**: Experimental Pass  
**Status**: Experimental

## Overview

**Purpose**: Optimize via phase polynomial extraction and simplification.

Phase polynomials provide a compact representation of linear reversible circuits with phase gates. By extracting the phase polynomial, we can apply algebraic simplifications and re-synthesize with fewer gates.

## Mini-Tutorial

### Phase Polynomials

**Representation**: f(x) = Σ c_i · (x_i₁ ⊕ x_i₂ ⊕ ... ⊕ x_iₖ)

**Process**:
1. Extract phase polynomial from circuit
2. Simplify algebraically
3. Re-synthesize optimally

### Why This Works

- **Algebraic simplification**: Combine like terms
- **Optimal synthesis**: Generate minimal circuit
- **T-count reduction**: Fewer non-Clifford gates

## Performance

- **T-count reduction**: 10-30% typical
- **T-depth reduction**: 20-50% typical
- **CNOT reduction**: 15-40% typical
- **Best for**: Clifford+T circuits
