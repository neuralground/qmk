# Constant Propagation Pass

**Category**: Standard Pass  
**Status**: Production-ready

## Overview

**Purpose**: Simplify gates when input states are known.

Constant propagation tracks known qubit states through the circuit and simplifies operations accordingly. This is especially effective for circuits with known initial states.

## Mini-Tutorial

### What is Constant Propagation?

**Constant propagation** = Using known values to simplify operations

In quantum circuits:
- Track known qubit states (|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, etc.)
- Simplify gates based on known inputs
- Evaluate operations at compile-time

### When States are Known

1. **Initial states**: Qubits start in |0⟩
2. **After preparation**: H|0⟩ = |+⟩
3. **After measurement**: Measurement outcome known
4. **Classical control**: Conditional on known value

### Why This Works

If we know the input state, we can:
- Evaluate gate effect at compile-time
- Remove gates with no effect
- Simplify controlled operations
- Optimize based on state

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Known Initial State

```
Before (q0 initialized to |0⟩):
  q0: |0⟩─Z─H─

After:
  q0: |0⟩─H─

Explanation: Z|0⟩ = |0⟩ (no effect)
Savings: 1 gate removed

Mathematical:
  Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]
  Z|0⟩ = [[1,0],[0,-1]]·[[1],[0]] = [[1],[0]] = |0⟩
```

### Example 2: Controlled Gate with Constant Control

```
Before (q0 = |0⟩):
  q0: |0⟩─●─
  q1: ────⊕─

After:
  q0: |0⟩───
  q1: ───────

Explanation: CNOT with control=|0⟩ has no effect
Savings: 1 CNOT removed

Why: CNOT only flips target when control=|1⟩
```

### Example 3: X Gate on Known State

```
Before (q0 = |0⟩):
  q0: |0⟩─X─H─

After (propagate X|0⟩ = |1⟩):
  q0: |1⟩─H─

Explanation: X flips |0⟩ to |1⟩, known at compile-time
Benefit: Enables further optimization with known |1⟩
```

### Example 4: Measurement Outcome

```
Before (measurement result known to be 0):
  q0: [M=0]─X─  (conditional on measurement)

After:
  q0: [M=0]

Explanation: Condition is false, X not executed
Savings: 1 gate removed

Why: If M=0, the conditional X (if M=1) never runs
```

### Example 5: H on Known State

```
Before (q0 = |0⟩):
  q0: |0⟩─H─X─

After (H|0⟩ = |+⟩):
  q0: |+⟩─X─

After (X|+⟩ = |-⟩):
  q0: |-⟩

Explanation: Propagate state through gates
Benefit: Know final state at compile-time
```

### Example 6: CNOT with Known States

```
Before (q0=|1⟩, q1=|0⟩):
  q0: |1⟩─●─
  q1: |0⟩─⊕─

After (CNOT flips target):
  q0: |1⟩───
  q1: |1⟩

Explanation: CNOT(|1⟩,|0⟩) = |1⟩|1⟩
Benefit: Know result state
```

### Example 7: Z on |+⟩ State

```
Before (q0 = |+⟩):
  q0: |+⟩─Z─

After (Z|+⟩ = |-⟩):
  q0: |-⟩

Explanation: Z flips phase of |+⟩
Mathematical:
  Z|+⟩ = Z(|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 = (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2 = |-⟩
```

### Example 8: Controlled-Z with Known Control

```
Before (q0=|0⟩):
  q0: |0⟩─●─
  q1: ────●─

After:
  q0: |0⟩───
  q1: ───────

Explanation: CZ with control=|0⟩ has no effect
Savings: 1 CZ removed
```

### Example 9: Toffoli with Known Controls

```
Before (q0=|1⟩, q1=|0⟩):
  q0: |1⟩─●─
  q1: |0⟩─●─
  q2: ────⊕─

After:
  q0: |1⟩───
  q1: |0⟩───
  q2: ───────

Explanation: Toffoli needs both controls=|1⟩
Since q1=|0⟩, no effect
Savings: 1 Toffoli removed
```

### Example 10: Real-World Circuit

```
Before (VQE with known initial states):
  q0: |0⟩─Z─H─●─RY(θ)─
  q1: |0⟩─X─H─⊕───────

After (propagate constants):
  q0: |0⟩─H─●─RY(θ)─
  q1: |1⟩─H─⊕───────

Explanation:
  - Z|0⟩ = |0⟩ (removed)
  - X|0⟩ = |1⟩ (evaluated)
  
Savings: 1 gate removed, 1 gate evaluated
```

## Propagation Rules

### Initial States
```
All qubits start in |0⟩ unless specified
```

### Gate Effects on |0⟩
```
X|0⟩ = |1⟩
H|0⟩ = |+⟩
Z|0⟩ = |0⟩ (no effect)
Y|0⟩ = i|1⟩
```

### Gate Effects on |1⟩
```
X|1⟩ = |0⟩
H|1⟩ = |-⟩
Z|1⟩ = -|1⟩
Y|1⟩ = -i|0⟩
```

### Controlled Gates
```
CNOT(|0⟩,|ψ⟩) = |0⟩|ψ⟩ (no effect)
CNOT(|1⟩,|ψ⟩) = |1⟩X|ψ⟩ (flip target)
CZ(|0⟩,|ψ⟩) = |0⟩|ψ⟩ (no effect)
```

## Analysis Algorithm

### Forward Propagation

```
1. Initialize: All qubits = |0⟩
2. For each gate:
   a. Check if inputs are known
   b. If known, evaluate gate effect
   c. Propagate result state
   d. Simplify if possible
3. Remove gates with no effect
```

### State Tracking

```
Track states:
- |0⟩, |1⟩ (computational basis)
- |+⟩, |-⟩ (Hadamard basis)
- Unknown (superposition)

Propagate through:
- Single-qubit gates
- Controlled gates
- Measurements
```

---

## Performance

- **Gate reduction**: 5-15% typical, up to 40% best case
- **Most effective on**: 
  - Circuits with known initial states
  - Circuits with classical control
  - Structured circuits
- **Overhead**: Low (few ms)
- **Best with**: Dead code elimination

---

## Implementation Notes

**Algorithm**:
1. Track known states
2. Propagate through gates
3. Simplify based on known values
4. Remove no-effect gates

**Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of gates

**State Space**: Track basis states, not full superpositions

---

## Usage

```python
from qir.optimizer.passes import ConstantPropagationPass

# Create pass
pass_obj = ConstantPropagationPass()

# Apply to circuit
optimized_circuit = pass_obj.run(circuit)

# Check metrics
print(f"Gates simplified: {pass_obj.metrics.gates_simplified}")
print(f"Gates removed: {pass_obj.metrics.gates_removed}")
```

---

## Common Patterns

### 1. Z on |0⟩
```
Z|0⟩ = |0⟩ → Remove Z
```

### 2. CNOT with |0⟩ Control
```
CNOT(|0⟩, |ψ⟩) = |0⟩|ψ⟩ → Remove CNOT
```

### 3. X Evaluation
```
X|0⟩ = |1⟩ → Propagate |1⟩
```

### 4. Conditional Simplification
```
If M=0 then X → Remove (condition false)
```
