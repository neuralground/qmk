# Gate Cancellation Pass

**Category**: Standard Pass  
**Status**: Production-ready

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Remove adjacent inverse gate pairs that cancel each other out.

Gate cancellation exploits the algebraic properties of quantum gates. Self-inverse gates (G² = I) and inverse pairs (G·G† = I) can be eliminated without changing circuit semantics.

## Mini-Tutorial

### Mathematical Background

- **Identity**: I|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩
- **Self-inverse**: G²|ψ⟩ = GG|ψ⟩ = I|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩
- **Inverse pair**: GG†|ψ⟩ = I|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩

### Why This Works

When two adjacent gates cancel, they have no net effect on the quantum state. Removing them preserves circuit semantics while reducing gate count.

### Cancellation Rules

**Self-Inverse Gates** (G² = I):
- H·H = I (Hadamard)
- X·X = I (Pauli-X)
- Y·Y = I (Pauli-Y)
- Z·Z = I (Pauli-Z)
- CNOT·CNOT = I
- SWAP·SWAP = I

**Inverse Pairs** (G·G† = I):
- S·S† = I (Phase gate)
- T·T† = I (π/8 gate)
- RZ(θ)·RZ(-θ) = I

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Hadamard Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─H─X─

After:
  q0: ─X─

Explanation: H² = I, so two Hadamards cancel
Savings: 2 gates → 0 gates (100% reduction)

State evolution:
  |0⟩ --H--> |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
      --H--> |0⟩  (back to original)
```

### Example 2: Pauli-X Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─X─X─H─

After:
  q0: ─H─

Explanation: X² = I (bit flip twice = no change)
Savings: 2 gates → 0 gates

State evolution:
  |0⟩ --X--> |1⟩
      --X--> |0⟩  (back to original)
```

### Example 3: CNOT Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─●─●─
  q1: ─⊕─⊕─

After:
  q0: ───
  q1: ───

Explanation: CNOT² = I (controlled-NOT twice = no change)
Savings: 2 CNOTs → 0 CNOTs

State evolution on |00⟩:
  |00⟩ --CNOT--> |00⟩ --CNOT--> |00⟩  (unchanged)

State evolution on |10⟩:
  |10⟩ --CNOT--> |11⟩ --CNOT--> |10⟩  (back to original)
```

### Example 4: S and S† Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─S─S†─H─

After:
  q0: ─H─

Explanation: S·S† = I (phase gate and its inverse cancel)
Savings: 2 gates → 0 gates

Mathematical:
  S = [[1, 0], [0, i]]
  S† = [[1, 0], [0, -i]]
  S·S† = [[1, 0], [0, i·(-i)]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I
```

### Example 5: T and T† Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─T─T†─X─

After:
  q0: ─X─

Explanation: T·T† = I (π/8 gate and its inverse cancel)
Savings: 2 gates → 0 gates

Why This Matters:
  T gates are expensive in fault-tolerant quantum computing
  (require magic state distillation). Cancelling them saves
  significant resources!

Cost Impact:
  Before: 2 T gates = 2000 physical gates
  After: 0 T gates = 0 physical gates
  Savings: 2000 physical gates!
```

### Example 6: Rotation Cancellation

```
Before:
  q0: ─RZ(π/4)─RZ(-π/4)─H─

After:
  q0: ─H─

Explanation: RZ(θ)·RZ(-θ) = RZ(0) = I
Savings: 2 rotations → 0 rotations

Mathematical:
  RZ(θ) = exp(-iθZ/2) = [[e^(-iθ/2), 0], [0, e^(iθ/2)]]
  RZ(θ)·RZ(-θ) = RZ(θ-θ) = RZ(0) = I
```

### Example 7: Complex Circuit

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─X─X─S─S†─H─T─T†─
  q1: ─●─⊕─⊕─●─────────────

After (first pass):
  q0: ─H─S─S†─H─T─T†─
  q1: ─●─────●───────

After (second pass):
  q0: ─H─H─T─T†─
  q1: ─●───────

After (third pass):
  q0: ─T─T†─
  q1: ───────

After (final pass):
  q0: ───
  q1: ───

Explanation: Multiple cancellations in sequence
Savings: 8 gates → 0 gates (100% reduction!)

This shows why multiple passes can be beneficial - each
cancellation may expose new cancellation opportunities.
```

### Example 8: Real-World Circuit (VQE Ansatz)

```
Before (12 gates):
  q0: ─RZ(θ₁)─H─●─H─RZ(θ₂)─H─●─H─RZ(θ₃)─
  q1: ──────────⊕────────────⊕──────────

After optimization (8 gates):
  q0: ─RZ(θ₁)─H─●─RZ(θ₂)─H─●─RZ(θ₃)─
  q1: ──────────⊕────────────⊕──────────

Explanation: H-CNOT-H pattern simplified
Savings: 4 H gates → 2 H gates (33% reduction)
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Measurement Basis Change
```
H-Measure-H → Just measure in X basis
```

### 2. Debugging Artifacts
```
X-X from debugging code left in
```

### 3. Compilation Artifacts
```
H-H from naive gate decomposition
```

### 4. Optimization Artifacts
```
Gates that cancel after other optimizations
```

---

## When It Doesn't Apply

### Non-adjacent gates:
```
q0: ─H─X─H─  (H gates not adjacent, can't cancel)
```

### Different qubits:
```
q0: ─H─
q1: ─H─  (Different qubits, can't cancel)
```

### Gates with different parameters:
```
q0: ─RZ(π/4)─RZ(π/3)─  (Different angles, can't cancel)
```

## Performance

- **Gate reduction**: 5-15% typical
- **Overhead**: Very low (<1ms for typical circuits)
- **Always beneficial**: No downside
- **Best on**: Unoptimized circuits, compiler output

---

## Implementation Notes

**Algorithm**:
1. Scan circuit for adjacent gates
2. Check if gates operate on same qubits
3. Check if gates are inverses
4. Remove both if they cancel
5. Repeat until no more cancellations

**Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of gates

---

## Usage

```python
from qir.optimizer.passes import GateCancellationPass

# Create pass
pass_obj = GateCancellationPass()

# Apply to circuit
optimized_circuit = pass_obj.run(circuit)

# Check metrics
print(f"Gates removed: {pass_obj.metrics.gates_removed}")
print(f"T gates removed: {pass_obj.metrics.t_gates_removed}")
```
