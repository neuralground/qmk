# Qubit Mapping Pass

**Category**: Hardware-Aware Optimization  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Impact**: Critical for minimizing SWAP overhead

---

## Overview

The Qubit Mapping Pass intelligently maps logical qubits to physical qubits to minimize SWAP overhead. By analyzing which qubits interact frequently and placing them close together on the hardware topology, this pass can dramatically reduce the number of SWAP gates needed.

**Key Insight**: Good initial placement is better than fixing bad placement with SWAPs!

## Mini-Tutorial: The Qubit Mapping Problem

### The Problem

**Given**:
- A quantum circuit with logical qubits (q0, q1, q2, ...)
- Hardware with physical qubits and limited connectivity
- A set of two-qubit gates in the circuit

**Goal**: Assign logical qubits to physical qubits to minimize total SWAP overhead

### Why It Matters

**Bad Mapping**:
```
Circuit: CNOT(q0,q1) appears 10 times

Linear hardware: p0—p1—p2—p3

Bad mapping: q0→p0, q1→p3
Result: Need 4 SWAPs per CNOT = 40 SWAPs total!
```

**Good Mapping**:
```
Same circuit: CNOT(q0,q1) appears 10 times

Good mapping: q0→p0, q1→p1
Result: 0 SWAPs needed (already adjacent)!
```

**Impact**: 40 SWAPs saved = 120 CNOT gates saved!

### The Interaction Graph

Build a graph showing which qubits interact:
```
Circuit:
  CNOT(q0, q1)  ← q0 and q1 interact
  CNOT(q1, q2)  ← q1 and q2 interact
  CNOT(q0, q1)  ← q0 and q1 interact again

Interaction Graph:
  q0 —(2)— q1 —(1)— q2
  
  Edge weights = interaction frequency
```

### Mapping Strategy

**Goal**: Map interaction graph onto hardware topology

**Linear Hardware**: p0—p1—p2—p3

**Best Mapping**:
```
q0 → p0
q1 → p1  (q0 and q1 interact frequently, place adjacent)
q2 → p2  (q1 and q2 interact, place adjacent)
```

**Result**: All interactions are between adjacent physical qubits!

## Algorithm

### 1. Interaction Analysis

```python
def analyze_interactions(circuit):
    interactions = {}
    
    for gate in circuit.gates:
        if gate.is_two_qubit():
            pair = (gate.qubit1, gate.qubit2)
            interactions[pair] = interactions.get(pair, 0) + 1
    
    return interactions
```

**Example**:
```python
Circuit:
  CNOT(q0, q1)
  CNOT(q1, q2)
  CNOT(q0, q1)
  CNOT(q0, q2)

Interactions:
  (q0, q1): 2  ← Most frequent
  (q1, q2): 1
  (q0, q2): 1
```

### 2. Greedy Mapping Algorithm

```
1. Sort qubit pairs by interaction frequency (highest first)
2. For the most frequent pair (q_a, q_b):
   - Place q_a at physical position 0
   - Place q_b at adjacent position
3. For each remaining pair:
   - If both qubits unmapped: find adjacent free positions
   - If one mapped: place other near it
   - If both mapped: skip
4. Place any remaining qubits in free positions
```

### 3. Distance Calculation

```python
def calculate_total_distance(interactions, mapping, topology):
    total = 0
    for (q_a, q_b), count in interactions.items():
        p_a = mapping[q_a]
        p_b = mapping[q_b]
        distance = topology.distance(p_a, p_b)
        total += distance * count
    return total
```

**Lower distance = better mapping**

## Examples

### Example 1: Linear Chain Circuit

**Circuit**:
```qir
CNOT q0, q1  (3 times)
CNOT q1, q2  (2 times)
CNOT q2, q3  (1 time)
```

**Interaction Analysis**:
```
(q0, q1): 3  ← Most frequent
(q1, q2): 2
(q2, q3): 1
```

**Hardware**: Linear p0—p1—p2—p3

**Optimal Mapping**:
```
q0 → p0
q1 → p1  (adjacent to q0)
q2 → p2  (adjacent to q1)
q3 → p3  (adjacent to q2)
```

**Result**: All interactions are adjacent! 0 SWAPs needed.

**Total Distance**: 3×1 + 2×1 + 1×1 = 6

---

### Example 2: Star Circuit

**Circuit**:
```qir
CNOT q0, q1  (5 times)
CNOT q0, q2  (4 times)
CNOT q0, q3  (3 times)
```

**Interaction Analysis**:
```
(q0, q1): 5  ← Most frequent
(q0, q2): 4
(q0, q3): 3

q0 is the "hub" - interacts with everyone
```

**Hardware**: T-shape
```
    p1
    |
p0—p2—p3
```

**Optimal Mapping**:
```
q0 → p2  (center position - hub)
q1 → p1  (adjacent to q0)
q2 → p0  (adjacent to q0)
q3 → p3  (adjacent to q0)
```

**Result**: All interactions are adjacent! 0 SWAPs needed.

**Total Distance**: 5×1 + 4×1 + 3×1 = 12

---

### Example 3: Bad vs Good Mapping

**Circuit**:
```qir
CNOT q0, q3  (10 times)
CNOT q1, q2  (1 time)
```

**Hardware**: Linear p0—p1—p2—p3

**Bad Mapping** (identity):
```
q0 → p0
q1 → p1
q2 → p2
q3 → p3

Distance for (q0,q3): 3 (need 6 SWAPs per gate)
Distance for (q1,q2): 1 (adjacent)
Total: 10×3 + 1×1 = 31
```

**Good Mapping** (optimized):
```
q0 → p0
q3 → p1  (place frequent pair adjacent!)
q1 → p2
q2 → p3

Distance for (q0,q3): 1 (adjacent!)
Distance for (q1,q2): 1 (adjacent!)
Total: 10×1 + 1×1 = 11
```

**Improvement**: 31 → 11 (64% reduction in distance!)

---

### Example 4: Grid Topology

**Circuit**:
```qir
CNOT q0, q1  (5 times)
CNOT q1, q2  (3 times)
CNOT q2, q3  (2 times)
```

**Hardware**: 2×3 Grid
```
p0—p1—p2
|  |  |
p3—p4—p5
```

**Optimal Mapping** (horizontal chain):
```
q0 → p0
q1 → p1
q2 → p2
q3 → p5

All frequent pairs are adjacent horizontally
```

**Alternative** (vertical):
```
q0 → p0
q1 → p3
q2 → p4
q3 → p5

Mix of horizontal and vertical adjacency
```

---

### Example 5: Bell State

**Circuit**:
```qir
H q0
CNOT q0, q1
```

**Interaction Analysis**:
```
(q0, q1): 1
```

**Any Topology**: Just place q0 and q1 adjacent

**Linear**: q0→p0, q1→p1  
**Grid**: q0→p0, q1→p1 (or p0→p3)  
**T-shape**: q0→p2, q1→p0 (or p1, p3, p4)

**Result**: 0 SWAPs needed

---

## Mapping Strategies

### 1. Greedy Frequency-Based (Current)

```
Sort pairs by frequency
Place most frequent pairs adjacent
```

**Pros**: Simple, fast, good results  
**Cons**: Not optimal, no lookahead

### 2. Graph Isomorphism

```
Find subgraph of hardware topology that matches interaction graph
```

**Pros**: Optimal for small circuits  
**Cons**: NP-complete, slow for large circuits

### 3. Simulated Annealing

```
Start with random mapping
Iteratively improve by swapping assignments
Accept worse solutions with decreasing probability
```

**Pros**: Can find near-optimal solutions  
**Cons**: Slow, non-deterministic

### 4. Integer Linear Programming (ILP)

```
Formulate as optimization problem
Use ILP solver
```

**Pros**: Optimal solution  
**Cons**: Very slow for large circuits

### 5. Machine Learning

```
Train model on (circuit, topology) → mapping
Use learned heuristics
```

**Pros**: Fast, can learn complex patterns  
**Cons**: Requires training data, may not generalize

## Performance Metrics

### Distance Metric

**Weighted Distance**:
```
Total Distance = Σ (interaction_count × physical_distance)
```

**Lower is better**

**Example**:
```
Interactions: (q0,q1):10, (q1,q2):5
Mapping: q0→p0, q1→p2, q2→p3

Distance = 10×distance(p0,p2) + 5×distance(p2,p3)
         = 10×2 + 5×1
         = 25
```

### SWAP Overhead Reduction

**Before Mapping**:
```
Random mapping → 50 SWAPs needed
```

**After Mapping**:
```
Optimized mapping → 10 SWAPs needed
```

**Reduction**: 80%

### Typical Results

**Linear Topology**:
- Random mapping: 30-50% SWAP overhead
- Optimized mapping: 10-20% SWAP overhead
- **Improvement**: 50-70% reduction

**Grid Topology**:
- Random mapping: 20-40% SWAP overhead
- Optimized mapping: 5-15% SWAP overhead
- **Improvement**: 60-75% reduction

## Integration with SWAP Insertion

### Workflow

```python
# Step 1: Analyze and optimize mapping
mapping_pass = QubitMappingPass(topology)
circuit = mapping_pass.run(circuit)

# Step 2: Insert SWAPs for remaining non-adjacent gates
swap_pass = SWAPInsertionPass(topology)
circuit = swap_pass.run(circuit)
```

### Why This Order Matters

**Wrong Order** (SWAP first):
```
1. Insert SWAPs with bad mapping
2. Try to optimize mapping (too late!)
Result: Many unnecessary SWAPs
```

**Right Order** (Mapping first):
```
1. Optimize mapping (minimize future SWAPs)
2. Insert only necessary SWAPs
Result: Minimal SWAP overhead
```

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Dynamic Mapping

Instead of static mapping, adapt during execution:
```python
def dynamic_mapping(circuit, topology):
    mapping = initial_mapping(circuit)
    
    for gate in circuit.gates:
        if not are_adjacent(gate, mapping):
            # Consider: Insert SWAP or remap?
            if should_remap(gate, remaining_gates):
                mapping = update_mapping(mapping, gate)
            else:
                insert_swap(gate, mapping)
```

### 2. Noise-Aware Mapping

Consider gate fidelities:
```python
def noise_aware_mapping(circuit, topology, fidelities):
    # Prefer high-fidelity connections
    # Weight edges by fidelity
    weighted_topology = apply_fidelities(topology, fidelities)
    return optimize_mapping(circuit, weighted_topology)
```

### 3. Temporal Mapping

Consider when gates execute:
```python
def temporal_mapping(circuit, topology):
    # Early gates: optimize for early interactions
    # Late gates: optimize for late interactions
    # Middle: balance both
    return time_aware_optimization(circuit, topology)
```

from qir.optimizer.passes import QubitMappingPass, SwapInsertionPass
from qir.optimizer.topology import LinearTopology

# Create circuit with frequent interactions
circuit = QIRCircuit()
q0 = circuit.add_qubit('q0')
q1 = circuit.add_qubit('q1')
q2 = circuit.add_qubit('q2')
q3 = circuit.add_qubit('q3')

# q0 and q3 interact frequently
for _ in range(10):
    circuit.add_gate('CNOT', [q0, q3])

# q1 and q2 interact once
circuit.add_gate('CNOT', [q1, q2])

# Define hardware
topology = LinearTopology(num_qubits=4)

# Run mapping optimization
mapping_pass = QubitMappingPass(topology)
circuit = mapping_pass.run(circuit)

# Check mapping quality
print(f"Total distance: {mapping_pass.metrics.custom['total_distance']}")
print(f"Average distance: {mapping_pass.metrics.custom['avg_distance']:.2f}")

# Now insert SWAPs
swap_pass = SwapInsertionPass(topology)
circuit = swap_pass.run(circuit)

print(f"SWAPs needed: {swap_pass.metrics.swap_gates_added}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Run Before SWAP Insertion

```python
# Good
manager = PassManager([
    QubitMappingPass(topology),
    SwapInsertionPass(topology)
])
```

### 2. Consider Circuit Structure

```python
# For star-like circuits, use T or star topology
if is_star_circuit(circuit):
    topology = TTopology()
else:
    topology = LinearTopology()
```

### 3. Combine with Other Optimizations

```python
# Best practice
manager = PassManager([
    GateCommutationPass(),        # Enable better mapping
    QubitMappingPass(topology),   # Optimize placement
    SwapInsertionPass(topology),  # Insert minimal SWAPs
    GateCancellationPass()        # Remove redundant SWAPs
])
```

2. **Noise-Aware**: Consider gate fidelities
3. **Dynamic Mapping**: Adapt during execution
4. **Machine Learning**: Learn optimal strategies
