# Uncomputation Optimization Pass

**Category**: Standard Pass  
**Status**: Production-ready

## Overview

**Purpose**: Optimize reversible uncomputation patterns.

Uncomputation is the process of reversing computation to free ancilla qubits. Optimizing uncomputation reduces ancilla usage and gate count.

## Mini-Tutorial

### What is Uncomputation?

**Uncomputation** = Reversing computation to free ancillas

**Pattern**: Compute → Use → Uncompute

**Goal**: Minimize ancilla usage and gate count

### Why Optimize?

- **Reduce ancilla count**: Fewer qubits needed
- **Reduce gate count**: Skip unnecessary uncomputation
- **Reuse results**: Avoid recomputation

---

## Performance

- **Gate reduction**: 10-20% typical
- **Ancilla reduction**: 20-40% typical
- **Best for**: Circuits with many ancillas
