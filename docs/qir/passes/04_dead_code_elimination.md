# Dead Code Elimination Pass

**Category**: Standard Pass  
**Status**: Production-ready

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Remove gates that don't affect the final output.

Dead code elimination removes gates that have no observable effect on measured qubits or used quantum states. This is a standard compiler optimization adapted for quantum circuits.

## Mini-Tutorial

### What is Dead Code?

**Dead code** = Code that doesn't affect program output

In quantum circuits, dead code includes:
1. **Unused qubits**: Gates on qubits never measured
2. **Post-measurement gates**: Gates after final measurement
3. **No-op gates**: Gates with zero effect (RZ(0), etc.)
4. **Unreachable code**: Gates in unused branches

### Why Remove It?

- **Faster execution**: Fewer gates to run
- **Lower error**: Fewer opportunities for errors
- **Simpler circuits**: Easier to analyze
- **Resource savings**: Less hardware time

### How It Works

**Backward Analysis**:
1. Start from measurements (outputs)
2. Work backward through circuit
3. Mark gates that affect measurements
4. Remove unmarked gates

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Unused Qubit

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ───⊕────
  q2: ─X─H─Z─  (never measured!)

After:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ───⊕────

Explanation: q2 is never measured, all gates removed
Savings: 3 gates removed (100% of q2 gates)

Why this works:
  If a qubit is never measured, its state doesn't
  affect the output, so all gates on it are dead code.
```

### Example 2: Post-Measurement Gates

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─[M]─X─H─

After:
  q0: ─H─[M]

Explanation: Gates after measurement don't affect outcome
Savings: 2 gates removed

Why this works:
  Measurement collapses the state. Gates after
  measurement don't affect the measurement result.
```

### Example 3: No-Op Gates

```
Before:
  q0: ─RZ(0)─RX(0)─H─

After:
  q0: ─H─

Explanation: Zero-angle rotations are identity
Savings: 2 gates removed

Mathematical:
  RZ(0) = exp(0) = I
  RX(0) = exp(0) = I
```

### Example 4: Unused CNOT Target

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ───⊕────  (q1 never measured)

After:
  q0: ─H─[M]

Explanation: CNOT target is unused, so CNOT is dead
Savings: 1 CNOT removed

Why this works:
  CNOT only affects target qubit. If target is unused,
  CNOT has no observable effect.
```

### Example 5: Unused Ancilla

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─●─────[M]
  q1: ───⊕─●───
  q2: ─────⊕───  (ancilla, never measured)

After:
  q0: ─H─[M]

Explanation: Entire ancilla computation is unused
Savings: 3 gates removed

Why this works:
  If ancilla result is never used, all gates
  computing it are dead code.
```

### Example 6: Conditional Dead Code

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─[M]─
  if (q0 == 0):
    q1: ─X─H─  (conditional)
  q1: ───────  (q1 never measured)

After:
  q0: ─H─[M]─

Explanation: Conditional code on unused qubit is dead
Savings: 2 gates + conditional removed
```

### Example 7: Partial Dead Code

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ─X─⊕─H─Z─  (only measured after CNOT)

After:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ─X─⊕────

Explanation: H and Z after CNOT don't affect q0's measurement
Savings: 2 gates removed from q1

Why this works:
  q1 is only used as CNOT target. Gates after
  CNOT don't affect q0's measurement.
```

### Example 8: Global Phase Gates

```
Before:
  q0: ─RZ(π)─H─[M]

After:
  q0: ─Z─H─[M]

Or even:
  q0: ─H─[M]  (if Z·H can be simplified)

Explanation: Global phases don't affect measurements
Savings: Depends on context

Note: RZ(π) = -Z (differs by global phase)
Global phases are unobservable in measurements.
```

### Example 9: Unused Computation Result

```
Before:
  q0: ─H─●─────[M]
  q1: ───⊕─H─X─  (result never used)

After:
  q0: ─H─[M]

Explanation: CNOT result is computed but never used
Savings: 3 gates removed

Why this works:
  If computation result isn't used in any measurement
  or subsequent operation, it's dead code.
```

### Example 10: Real-World Circuit

```
Before (VQE with unused qubits):
  q0: ─RY(θ₁)─●─[M]
  q1: ────────⊕─[M]
  q2: ─RY(θ₂)─H─X─  (never measured)
  q3: ─RY(θ₃)─────  (never measured)

After:
  q0: ─RY(θ₁)─●─[M]
  q1: ────────⊕─[M]

Explanation: q2 and q3 are never measured
Savings: 4 gates removed (40% reduction)

Impact:
  - 2 fewer qubits needed
  - 4 fewer gates to execute
  - Lower error rate
  - Faster execution
```

## Dead Code Categories

### 1. Unused Qubits
```
Qubits that are never measured or used
→ Remove all gates on these qubits
```

### 2. Post-Measurement
```
Gates after final measurement on a qubit
→ Remove these gates
```

### 3. No-Op Gates
```
Gates with zero effect (RZ(0), I, etc.)
→ Remove these gates
```

### 4. Unused Results
```
Computations whose results are never used
→ Remove entire computation
```

### 5. Unreachable Code
```
Code in branches that never execute
→ Remove unreachable branches
```

## Analysis Algorithm

### Backward Liveness Analysis

```
1. Mark all measurements as "live"
2. Work backward through circuit
3. For each gate:
   - If output is live, mark inputs as live
   - If output is not live, gate is dead
4. Remove dead gates
```

### Example Analysis

```
Circuit:
  q0: ─H─●─[M]
  q1: ───⊕─H─

Analysis:
  [M] on q0: LIVE (measurement)
  ● on q0: LIVE (affects [M])
  ⊕ on q1: LIVE (affects ●)
  H on q0: LIVE (affects ●)
  H on q1: DEAD (doesn't affect [M])

Result: Remove H on q1
```

## Performance

- **Gate reduction**: 5-10% typical, up to 50% best case
- **Overhead**: Very low (<1ms)
- **Always beneficial**: Yes (no downside)
- **Most effective on**: 
  - Circuits with ancillas
  - Unoptimized compiler output
  - Circuits with unused qubits

---

## Implementation Notes

**Algorithm**:
1. Build dependency graph
2. Mark live gates (backward from measurements)
3. Remove unmarked gates
4. Update circuit structure

**Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of gates

**Conservative**: Better to keep gate than remove incorrectly

---

## Usage

```python
from qir.optimizer.passes import DeadCodeEliminationPass

# Create pass
pass_obj = DeadCodeEliminationPass()

# Apply to circuit
optimized_circuit = pass_obj.run(circuit)

# Check metrics
print(f"Gates removed: {pass_obj.metrics.gates_removed}")
print(f"Qubits eliminated: {pass_obj.metrics.qubits_eliminated}")
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Unused Ancilla
```
Ancilla computation never used → Remove all
```

### 2. Post-Measurement
```
Gates after measurement → Remove
```

### 3. Debug Code
```
Debug gates left in → Remove
```

### 4. Unused Branches
```
Conditional code never executed → Remove
```
