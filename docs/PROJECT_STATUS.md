**Previous Issues - Now Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Gate Cancellation Safety**: `test_commutation_vs_qiskit`
   - **Location**: `tests/integration/test_commutation_validation.py:66`
   - **Root Cause**: Cancellation could remove gates leaving qubits uninitialized
   - **Fix Implemented**: Added safety check to prevent uninitialized qubits
   - **Status**: Fixed with safety guard, test remains skipped due to QVM linearity semantics
   - **Impact**: Low - affects edge cases only, safety check prevents issues

2. ✅ **Validator Robustness**: Fuzz testing revealed type validation issue
   - **Root Cause**: Validator didn't check if nodes was a list
   - **Fix Implemented**: Added type validation for nodes field
   - **Status**: Fixed and tested with 18 fuzz tests
   - **Impact**: Improved robustness

**Collection Errors**:
2. ⚠️ **4 Test Collection Errors**
   - **Command**: `pytest tests/ --collect-only` shows "4 errors"
   - **Impact**: Unknown - tests may not be running
   - **Status**: Needs investigation

**TODOs in Code**:
3. ⚠️ **QIR Conversion TODO**
   - **Location**: `tests/integration/test_end_to_end_validation.py:81`
   - **Issue**: "TODO: QIR conversion" - manually creating QVM graphs
   - **Impact**: Low - workaround exists
   - **Status**: Enhancement needed

4. ⚠️ **Full QIR Path TODO**
   - **Location**: `tests/integration/test_end_to_end_validation.py:144`
   - **Issue**: "TODO: Full QIR path with optimization"
   - **Impact**: Low - testing works without it
   - **Status**: Enhancement needed

5. ⚠️ **Comparison Logic TODO**
   - **Location**: `kernel/hardware/qiskit_simulator_backend.py:294`
   - **Issue**: "TODO: Implement detailed comparison logic"
   - **Impact**: Low - basic comparison works
   - **Status**: Enhancement needed
