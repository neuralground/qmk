; Shor's Algorithm - Quantum Period Finding Subroutine
;
; This is the quantum core of Shor's factoring algorithm.
; Given N (number to factor) and a (coprime to N), find the period r
; where a^r mod N = 1.
;
; This is a simplified pedagogical version demonstrating the circuit structure.
; A full implementation would require:
; - More counting qubits for precision
; - Proper modular exponentiation circuits
; - Full QFT implementation
;
; Parameters:
;   n_count_qubits - Number of counting qubits (default 3)
;   N - Number to factor (informational, not used in simplified version)
;   a - Base for modular exponentiation (informational)

.version 0.1
.caps CAP_ALLOC CAP_COMPUTE CAP_MEASURE

; Parameters
.param n_count_qubits = 3
.param N = 15
.param a = 7

; Allocate counting qubits and work qubit
.set n_total = n_count_qubits + 1
alloc: ALLOC_LQ n={n_total}, profile="logical:Surface(d=3)" -> count_0, count_1, count_2, work_0

; === Phase 1: Initialize Counting Qubits in Superposition ===
.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    h_count_{i}: APPLY_H count_{i}
.endfor

; Initialize work qubit to |1⟩
x_work: APPLY_X work_0

; === Phase 2: Controlled Modular Exponentiation ===
; In full Shor's, this would be controlled-U^(2^j) operations
; where U|y⟩ = |ay mod N⟩
; Here we use simplified CNOT for demonstration
.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    ctrl_exp_{i}: APPLY_CNOT count_{i}, work_0
.endfor

; === Phase 3: Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ===
; Simplified QFT on counting qubits
; Full QFT would include controlled rotations

; Swap qubits (part of QFT)
qft_swap_0_2_cnot1: APPLY_CNOT count_0, count_2
qft_swap_0_2_cnot2: APPLY_CNOT count_2, count_0
qft_swap_0_2_cnot3: APPLY_CNOT count_0, count_2

; Apply Hadamards (simplified QFT)
.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    qft_h_{i}: APPLY_H count_{i}
.endfor

; === Phase 4: Measure Counting Qubits ===
; Measurement collapses to a value that encodes the period
.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    measure_count_{i}: MEASURE_Z count_{i} -> m{i}
.endfor
