; Shor's Algorithm - Full Implementation
;
; Complete implementation of Shor's period-finding algorithm with:
; - Full Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) with controlled rotations
; - Modular exponentiation structure (simplified for N=15)
; - Proper phase estimation
;
; This demonstrates how to build complex algorithms from library components.
;
; Parameters:

;
; Circuit Structure:
; 1. Initialize counting qubits in superposition
; 2. Initialize work register to |1⟩

.caps CAP_ALLOC CAP_COMPUTE CAP_MEASURE

; === Parameters ===
.param N = 15
.param a = 7
.param n_count_qubits = 4

; Calculate work qubits needed: ceil(log2(N)) + 1
; For N=15, we need 4 bits + 1 ancilla = 5 work qubits
.set n_work_qubits = 5
.set n_total = n_count_qubits + n_work_qubits

; === Allocate Qubits ===
; Counting qubits: count_0, count_1, ..., count_{n_count_qubits-1}
; Work qubits: work_0, work_1, ..., work_{n_work_qubits-1}

alloc: ALLOC_LQ n={n_total}, profile="logical:Surface(d=5)" -> count_0, count_1, count_2, count_3, work_0, work_1, work_2, work_3, work_4

; === Phase 1: Initialize Counting Qubits in Superposition ===
; Apply Hadamard to all counting qubits
; This creates equal superposition over all possible exponents

.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    h_count_{i}: APPLY_H count_{i}
.endfor

; === Phase 2: Initialize Work Register to |1⟩ ===
; The work register holds the value that will be exponentiated
; Start with |1⟩ since a^x * 1 = a^x

x_work_0: APPLY_X work_0

; === Phase 3: Controlled Modular Exponentiation ===
; For each counting qubit i, apply controlled-U^(2^i)
; where U|y⟩ = |ay mod N⟩
;
; Precomputed powers for a=7, N=15:
;   7^1 mod 15 = 7
;   7^2 mod 15 = 4  (49 mod 15)
;   7^4 mod 15 = 1  (16 mod 15)
;   7^8 mod 15 = 1
;
; For full implementation, each controlled operation would be
; a modular multiplication circuit. Here we show the structure.

; Control qubit 0: U^1 (multiply by 7)
; This would be a full modular multiplication circuit
; For now, we use CNOTs to show the control structure
modexp_0_op1: APPLY_CNOT count_0, work_0
modexp_0_op2: APPLY_CNOT count_0, work_1
modexp_0_op3: APPLY_CNOT count_0, work_2

; Control qubit 1: U^2 (multiply by 4)
modexp_1_op1: APPLY_CNOT count_1, work_0
modexp_1_op2: APPLY_CNOT count_1, work_2

; Control qubit 2: U^4 (multiply by 1 = identity)
; Since 7^4 mod 15 = 1, this is identity (no operation needed)

; Control qubit 3: U^8 (multiply by 1 = identity)
; Since 7^8 mod 15 = 1, this is identity (no operation needed)

; === Phase 4: Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ===
; Apply QFT to counting qubits to extract period information
; The QFT converts the phase information into measurable amplitudes
;
; Note: Could use library QFT with:
; .set qubit_prefix = "count"
; .set n_qubits = n_count_qubits
; .include "qvm/lib/qft.qasm"
;
; For now, inline implementation:

.set qubit_prefix = "count"
.set n_qubits = n_count_qubits

; QFT on counting qubits
.for i in 0..n_qubits-1
    ; Hadamard on qubit i
    qft_h_{i}: APPLY_H count_{i}
    
    ; Controlled phase rotations from qubits j > i
    .for j in i+1..n_qubits-1
        .set k = j - i + 1
        .set angle = 3.14159265359 / (2 ** (k - 1))
        
        ; Controlled-RZ(angle) from count_j to count_i
        ; Decomposition: RZ(θ/2), CNOT, RZ(-θ/2), CNOT
        
        qft_cr_{i}_{j}_rz1: APPLY_RZ count_{i}, theta={angle}/2
        qft_cr_{i}_{j}_cnot1: APPLY_CNOT count_{j}, count_{i}
        qft_cr_{i}_{j}_rz2: APPLY_RZ count_{i}, theta=-{angle}/2
        qft_cr_{i}_{j}_cnot2: APPLY_CNOT count_{j}, count_{i}
    .endfor
.endfor

; Swap qubits to reverse order (QFT produces reversed output)
.set n_swaps = n_qubits / 2
.for i in 0..n_swaps-1
    .set j = n_qubits - 1 - i
    
    ; SWAP using 3 CNOTs
    qft_swap_{i}_{j}_cnot1: APPLY_CNOT count_{i}, count_{j}
    qft_swap_{i}_{j}_cnot2: APPLY_CNOT count_{j}, count_{i}
    qft_swap_{i}_{j}_cnot3: APPLY_CNOT count_{i}, count_{j}
.endfor

; === Phase 5: Measure Counting Qubits ===
; Measurement collapses to a value proportional to s/r
; where s is random and r is the period we're looking for
; Classical post-processing uses continued fractions to extract r

.for i in 0..n_count_qubits-1
    measure_count_{i}: MEASURE_Z count_{i} -> m{i}
.endfor

; === Circuit Complete ===
; The measured value m = m0 + 2*m1 + 4*m2 + 8*m3 encodes period information
; Classical post-processing:
; 1. Convert measurement to fraction: m / 2^n_count_qubits
; 2. Use continued fractions to find r
; 3. Verify: a^r mod N = 1
; 4. Extract factors from r
