Lattice Surgery Optimization Pass

Optimizes circuits for lattice surgery-based quantum error correction.

Lattice surgery is a technique for performing logical operations between
surface code patches without physical qubit movement. It's critical for:
- Surface code quantum computing
- Topological quantum computing
- Scalable fault-tolerant architectures

Operations:
- Merge: Combine two logical qubits
- Split: Separate logical qubits
- Twist: Implement logical gates
- Measurement: Logical measurements

Optimization Goals:
- Minimize merge/split operations
- Optimize patch layout
- Reduce surgery time
- Minimize resource overhead

Example:
  Before: Multiple small surgeries
  After:  Combined surgery operations
  Benefit: Reduced overhead and time
